## Problem Statement

The objective of building this system was to describe the phenomenon and role of improvising in health care 
settings. Looking at the scenario of healthcare today, a need to improve the availability of healthcare facilities to 
most technology users is observed. Healthcare is a part of life we all consider to be something we are entitled to –
it is our right to have access to healthcare whenever we need it.
To make it easy for the public to have a direct and efficient report of their health, using technology is a great way. 
Introduction to eHealth is essential for revolutionizing the health sector in India. eHealth enhances patient-centered 
healthcare by providing digital solutions to improve the quality of care and communication between doctors and 
patients.
